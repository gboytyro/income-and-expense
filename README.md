# Freedom Gap Visualization

The **Freedom Gap** is the distance between your income and expenses over time. In this visualization, the shaded **Freedom Zone** shows how much surplus you can direct toward savings and investment. The wider the gap, the faster you can build financial resilience and independence.

## Why this visualization matters

The Freedom Gap chart helps illustrate how two habits shape long-term outcomes:

- **Growing income** through skills, promotions, or additional income streams.
- **Managing expenses** so they grow more slowly than income.

By keeping expenses under control while income rises, the shaded Freedom Zone expands year after year, representing cumulative surplus that can be invested toward financial freedom.
